# Advanced-Memory-Management-System-Prototype
###It is basically a c program which is a little bit advanced, it uses a user written library from which it imports its functions to run the program.

Requirements:
* C compiler(I used gcc)

**How to run the program**
* Firstly, clone the Repo
* Open command prompt reach over there using cd
* Type _gcc main.c mem.c_ and enter
* Then type _./a.out_

**mem.h** is a library header file which just declares the variables, functions and structures and **mem.c** is where these functions' code is written. So what _gcc main.c mem.c_ does is, it imports that library into main file.
